# Airbnb-price-prediction-regression

### Problem Statement
Letâ€™s say we want to build a model to predict booking prices on Airbnb. Between linear regression and random forest regression, which model would perform better and why?

We used the dataset from Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tahirelfaki/airbnb/data] for the regression models. We also included XGBoost Regression model to compare among the two other models to determine which one worked the best.
